# Air Quality and Urban Sustainability: Leveraging Bike-Sharing for Greener Cities

This repository contains code related to global city bike networks and air quality metrics. It integrates data from various bike-sharing programs with air quality information (AQI) to explore correlations between bike station distribution and environmental factors such as pollution. Population metric data is included for further analysis.
